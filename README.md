# MEANapp
**MEAN Stack Application**
**Project Name**: MEAN Stack Application
**Description**
This project is a full-stack web application developed using the MEAN stack, which comprises MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. The application leverages the strengths of each technology to create a seamless, efficient, and scalable solution.

MongoDB is used for the database to store and manage application data.
Express.js serves as the backend framework, providing a robust environment for handling server-side logic.
Angular is used for building a responsive and dynamic front-end user interface.
Node.js is employed for the server environment, enabling fast and scalable network applications.


The application demonstrates modern web development practices and integrates key features such as:
  User authentication and authorization
  CRUD operations
  RESTful API communication between the front-end and back-end
  Error handling and performance optimization
  This project aims to provide a hands-on understanding of how the MEAN stack works together in building web applications, from client-side interaction to server-side processing and database management.

Technologies Used:
  MongoDB
  Express.js
  Angular (Angular 14+)
  Node.js
  Mongoose (for MongoDB object modeling)
  JWT (for user authentication)
